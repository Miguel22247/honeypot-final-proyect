# Security Warnings and Best Practices

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY WARNINGS

### Honeypot Nature

This system is specifically designed to **attract attackers**. By its very nature, it will:

- Receive malicious traffic
- Log attack attempts and methods
- Download malware samples
- Capture attacker commands and behavior

### Legal Considerations

- **Compliance:** Ensure your honeypot deployment complies with local laws and regulations
- **Notification:** Some jurisdictions may require notification of monitoring activities
- **Data Retention:** Follow applicable data retention and privacy laws
- **Evidence Handling:** Properly document and preserve evidence for potential legal proceedings

### Network Security

- **Isolation:** Deploy on isolated network segments or VLANs
- **Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive network monitoring
- **Containment:** Ensure attackers cannot pivot to production systems
- **Firewall:** Use strict firewall rules to control traffic flow

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY BEST PRACTICES

### Deployment Security

#### Network Isolation

```bash
# Example: Isolate honeypot on separate VLAN
# Configure switch port for VLAN 100 (honeypot network)
# Ensure no routing to production networks
```

#### Monitoring Setup

- **SIEM Integration:** Forward logs to Security Information and Event Management systems
- **Alerting:** Set up alerts for unusual activity patterns
- **Baseline:** Establish normal behavior patterns for comparison

#### Access Control

- **SSH Keys:** Use SSH key authentication instead of passwords for administrative access
- **VPN:** Access honeypot management through VPN only
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit administrative access to essential personnel only

### Data Protection

#### Log Security

- **Encryption:** Encrypt log files at rest and in transit
- **Backup:** Regular backups with secure storage
- **Retention:** Follow best practices for log retention and deletion

#### Incident Response

- **Documentation:** Keep detailed records of all incidents
- **Notification:** Inform relevant parties as required
- **Review:** Regularly review and update security policies

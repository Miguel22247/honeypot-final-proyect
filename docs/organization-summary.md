# Documentation Organization Summary

## What Was Moved

The `cowrie-setup.sh` script has been significantly improved by moving all informational content to a dedicated documentation structure.

### Before: Monolithic Script Output

- Large embedded final information display (50+ lines)
- Mixed installation logic with documentation
- Hard-coded help text throughout the script
- Difficult to reference information after installation

### After: Modular Documentation Structure

- Clean, focused script output
- Comprehensive documentation in dedicated files
- Easy to reference and maintain separately
- Professional documentation structure

## New Documentation Structure

```plaintext
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                 # Documentation index and navigation
â”œâ”€â”€ installation-guide.md     # Complete setup instructions
â”œâ”€â”€ setup-complete.md         # Post-installation management info
â””â”€â”€ security-warnings.md      # Critical security considerations

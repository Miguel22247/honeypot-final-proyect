# Honeypot for Cyberattack Monitoring

This project teaches you how to deploy honeypots like Cowrie and Honeyd to simulate vulnerable systems. These honeypots will attract real-world attackers, and you will collect and analyze attack data to understand common techniques, tools, and origins. Deliverables include threat trend reports, log analysis, and recommendations for improving system defenses based on observed behavior.

* Objective: Deploy honeypots to study attacker methods in the wild.
* Tools: Cowrie (SSH), Honeyd, ELK, Suricata.
* Team Size: 3
* Duration: 1 month
* Timeline:
  * Week 1: Deploy Cowrie on public VPS, configure with fake credentials.
  * Week 2: Capture attacker commands, upload behavior.
  * Week 3: Analyze patterns, fingerprint attacks (IP, country, tools used).
  * Week 4: Report results, suggest network hardening.
* Deliverables: Honeypot logs, attack timeline, network analysis report.
